# Auto eCOMM TestBot

## The goal

Our goal is to develop and train an automated user experience TestBot that is able to predict the satisfaction of an user navigating an ecommerce mobile website.

## Approach

We are designing a survey to collect output data regarding user experience and satisfaction. Input data is scrapped using audit tools like lighthouse, web accessibility, and other custom metrics. In the end we are training a model to predict user satisfaction for a new website.

Audience we are targeting with the product is comprised of shop owners, development companies and individual developers aiming to improve their website.
